# Electric Vehicle Battery Model (EVBM) Optimization

This repository contains the simulation and optimization framework for modeling the electric vehicle (EV) charging cycle, home energy demand, solar generation, and bi-directional battery storage using Python. It includes a progression of iterations, starting from simple static models to refined dynamic optimization using control theory and solar data integration.

## üîç Project Overview

The objective of this project is to simulate and optimize the power flow in a residential setup involving:

- An Electric Vehicle (EV)
- A Battery Storage System
- A Solar PV Array
- Home Demand Load
- Grid/Utility Power

## üìå Goals

- Develop a dynamic simulation of EV and battery state of charge (SOC).
- Implement solar data using `pvLib`.
- Optimize grid usage via `cvxpy`.
- Validate energy flow and cost-saving effectiveness under seasonal and demand variation.
